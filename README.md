# Awesome-Security-Tool-List

This is a list of security tools that I have used or recommend. Welcome any contributions!

## Tools

1. [Binwalk](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk): Firmware analysis & reverse engineering.
   - **Example: `binwalk -Mre <filename>`**
   - `-M`: recursively scan extracted files.
   - `-r`: delete carved file after extraction. ([what is file carving?](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/file-carving/#gref))
   - `-e`: extract known file types.
